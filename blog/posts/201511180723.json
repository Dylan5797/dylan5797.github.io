<p>This is my first post! I hopefully finally got my JavaScipt powered blog working. I felt like designing my own, probably terrible blog system so I didn't have to give credit to those blog tool websites (I don't like the "made with love" thing Jekyll puts at the bottom of your page :P). So basically, this blog system is handmade, at least by me.
