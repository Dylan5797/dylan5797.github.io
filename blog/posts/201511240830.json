When you take the price of internet-especially data plans, groceries and gas will look cheap when you compare the value ratios of what you're actually paying for. A megabyte is becoming less value in our digital world. And yet, the prices of the transfer of binary data are going up. When I said that a magabyte is becoming less value, I didn't mean literally. I meant that now, the services we use online are using more and more data, and our prices are going up and up. Think of it. An hour-long low-def movie is about 750Mb, notice the ripoff? I get 30Gb a month. My family pays $40 for 240000000000 binary digits, which we can use to make http, and https requests with. My mom pays $70 for 1Gb on her phone. <i>Internet,</i> is a ripoff."}
