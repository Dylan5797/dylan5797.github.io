I really need to get with the blogging program. So nobody knows what I've done in the last 13 days. Here's a list:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>I don't have to wear my retainer during the day anymore</li>\n<li>I wrote a <a href=\"https://github.com/Dylan5797/BBCodeParser\">BBCode parser in python</a></li>\n<li>I wrote a web server with socket in python</li>\n<li>I tried to create low poly with scratch (and failed)</li>\n<li>I discovered that non-semitone notes do not translate to non-decimal hertz values</li>\n<li>I aced 2 tests at school</li>\n</ul>\n\nThat's pretty much it (unless I count other stuff I made :P)"}
