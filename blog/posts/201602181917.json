{"content": "<p>Today, I experienced a 10-hour internet outage. <a href=\"http://memesvault.com/wp-content/uploads/Nooo-Meme-Darth-Vader-04.jpg\">NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU</a>. I did some digging, and I was still able to see my friend's IP address (I received \"Connection Refused\", not the regular timeout when I tried to ping my DNS server.)</p><p>So that was weird. I went to my school, which got its internet from satellite, and checked my ISPs website. Nothing addressing an outage. So I checked the BC Hydro website. Bam. There was an outage on a mountain nearby. My ISPs main communications base in fact. Fisrt thing that I thought was \"Why am I not on backup?\"</p><p>I've been to <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Bullhead+Mountain,+Hudson's+Hope,+BC+V0C\">that mountain</a> before, and there's a little puny single-phase 25kV line going up the side. That's like putting toothpicks in the side of a scoop of ice cream. If I were designing this, I would take the time to run a transmission line up the mountain (there's one right beside it in fact!). So for my whole 10 hours of pain and misery, I've got bad planning back in the 1990s to blame.</p><br><br><br><br><small>exaggeration intended :P</small>", "title": "Internet Outage", "timestamp": "201602181917"}
