{"title": "Dimensions", "content": "<p>Dimensions are cool. They all kind of give us a playground. A position, timeframe, and universe. I was mostly thinking about time, which is the fourth dimension. This means that you are now in a different dimension. And now. And now. And now. Because if we actually stayed in one dimension our whole lives, we would be stuck in a still world, unable to perceive, move, or live because we are stuck in a timeframe. We are actually moving through dimensions very fast. Here's a fact: You've been through \u221e dimensions in the past second. It's true. Even when you die, you're still going through \u221e dimensions per second. This is because every timeframe is a different dimension. Why \u221e? Time is only our perception; there is actually no limit or number of dimensions that pass between every \"frame\" of our perception of the universe. This also means that if you were fast enough to see every timeframe (which is physically impossible), you wouldn't last a single second, you'd probably die in less than a second of human perception. Again, this is because there are \u221e timeframes in 1 second. A normal human wouldn't even <i>see</i> you live. Also, if you lived that fast, you would probably be able to walk faster than the speed of light.</p>\n<p>But I still wonder why time is the fourth dimension, and not the tenth, because time oversees <b>everything</b>. Time can be a frame of multiple sets of dimensions. Can't it?</p>\n<p>Also, dimension travelling. Will it exist? I know we can travel the first 3 dimensions. But I don't know what we can do to suddenly disappear from our universe and appear in another one. It's something to think about.</p>\n", "timestamp": "201512131052"}
