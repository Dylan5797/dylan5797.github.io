{"content": "<p>I just learned a few exponent laws, and I have a couple thoughts. I know now that 2<sup>6</sup> / 2<sup>2</sup> = 2<sup>6-2</sup> So<br></p>\n<code>\nimport math\nmath.pow(2, 8) / math.pow(2, 6) == math.pow(2, 8-6)\n</code>\n<p>Should equal true (which it does :P). I guess because exponents' value increases by at least twice the value of the exponent to one less power. So I guess that 2<sup>6</sup> is 64 (my favourite number, just because 2+6 is 8 is another power of 2 xD) and 64 / 2<sup>4</sup> is 4, 2<sup>2</sup>, just because you can consider exponents like different bases, in this case, 2 (xP a.k.a binary) and we all know this works with 10... Anyways, graphing exponents is so predictable...</p><img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13187260/11303591/fa0dc736-8f60-11e5-9928-999a02d5b25a.png\">", "timestamp": "201511200831", "title": "Exponents"}
