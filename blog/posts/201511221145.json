CSS is really important in website design in the modern world. Look at google with no css:\n<img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13187260/11325563/3b401610-910e-11e5-9cd7-1506b6659faa.PNG\" width=400px>\nIt looks something like<br></p>\n<code>\n.class-name {<br>\n\tbackground-color: #EE66EE;<br>\n\tborder-bottom: 1px solid rgba(40, 60, 80, 0.5);<br>\n}<br>\nbody {<br>\n\tbackground-image: url(https://www.google.ca/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png)<br>\n}<br>\n</code><p>CSS can get messy (look at css for this website :P.) That's why there should be better orginization support to make it earier to find stuff hidden in lines and lines of code. I am thinking of making a cleaner css compiler. I'll post later if I'm successful."}
